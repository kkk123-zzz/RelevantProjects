# Google Stock Price Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict Google's daily stock price movements using historical data from 2010–2023.

## Files
- `GoogleStock_ML.ipynb`: Colab notebook containing data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- `Report_GoogleStock_ML.pdf`: Analytical report documenting methodology, results, and discussion.

## Tools and Libraries
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, Google Colab

## Key Features
- Built ML pipeline with 14 engineered features (returns, moving averages, volatility).
- Evaluated model performance using MAE and RMSE.
- Visualised predictions vs. actual prices and trend deviations.

## How to View
