📊 Financial Modelling & Valuation Project (FITP)

This repository contains a comprehensive financial modelling project completed as part of the UTS subject 31255 – Finance for IT Professionals (FITP).
The model was built entirely in Microsoft Excel, following strict requirements ensuring all calculations were formula-driven with zero hard-coded answers.

The project covers 110 tasks, including financial statements, valuation, capital budgeting, ratios, risk/return, and M&A scenarios, resulting in a full multi-sheet analytical model.

🧩 Project Overview

This model includes:

✔ Financial Statements

Completed Balance Sheet and Income Statement

Automated linkages between statements

Horizontal, vertical, and YoY (%) analyses

✔ Statement of Cash Flows

Indirect method

Automated reconciliation with BS & IS

✔ Financial Ratios

Includes all 5 major categories:

Liquidity

Profitability

Solvency

Efficiency

Market value ratios

✔ Capital Budgeting Techniques

Full valuation of an investment project using:

NPV

IRR & MIRR

Payback Period (PBP & DPBP)

Profitability Index (PI)

Accounting Rate of Return (ARR)

✔ Time Value of Money Calculations

FV, PV

Effective interest rate

Ordinary annuity (PV / FV)

Period calculations

✔ Risk & Return Analysis

Expected return

Variance & volatility

Including valuation impacts & resulting ratios.

📈 Impact & Key Outcomes

As part of the modelling work:

Built a fully automated Excel model with formula-driven calculations, ensuring 100% error-free consistency across 110 required tasks.

Identified investment projects with 12–18% expected return using NPV, IRR, MIRR and PI evaluations.

Benchmarked 5 company profiles, uncovering performance differences via horizontal/vertical analysis and ratio comparison.

Improved model clarity with structured dashboards and labelled calculation flows, enabling quick decision insight for financial evaluation.
