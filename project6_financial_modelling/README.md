Financial Modelling & Valuation Project (FITP)

This repository contains a financial modelling project completed as part of the UTS subject 31255 – Finance for IT Professionals (FITP). The model was built in Microsoft Excel and follows strict requirements for fully formula-driven calculations across all tasks.


Project Overview

The Excel model includes:

Completed Balance Sheet and Income Statement with automated links

Horizontal, vertical and year-on-year analysis

Statement of Cash Flows (indirect method)

Full ratio analysis across liquidity, profitability, solvency, efficiency and market value

Capital budgeting techniques including NPV, IRR, MIRR, Payback Period and Profitability Index

Time value of money calculations (FV, PV, effective interest rate, annuities)

Risk and return analysis (expected return, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation)

M&A scenario analysis including cash, scrip and combined offers



Key Outcomes

Built a fully automated Excel financial model with formula-based calculations and no hard-coded values.

Identified investment scenarios with estimated returns of approximately 12–18 percent under different assumptions.

Benchmarked five company profiles using ratios and trend analysis to highlight differences in financial performance.

Improved clarity of financial interpretation through structured worksheets and organised modelling logic.
